#Simple Search Engine
This project implements a simple search engine that allows users to search for URLs based on keywords. It utilizes a Binary Search Tree (BST) data structure to efficiently store and retrieve the data.
#Overview
Search engines have become an integral part of our lives, and this project aims to provide a basic implementation of a search engine using console-based interface.
#Input Format
The program reads data from a file with the following format:
•	Each pair of lines represents a data item.
•	The first line contains an ID and a URL.
•	The second line contains a set of keywords (space-separated).
•	Blank lines separate pairs of lines.
•	Two consecutive blank lines indicate the end of the file.
#Program
The program functions as follows:
1.	Ask the user for a filename.
2.	Read data from the file and construct a BST.
3.	Present a menu to the user.
4.	Allow the user to enter keywords for searching.
5.	Output the list of URLs that match the keywords.
#Setting up of the Interface
Setting up a simple console-based interface. Although it doesn't provide proper  functionality, it is able to read from a file, ask the user for keywords to search, and handle invalid input.
#Implementation of the Search Engine
 Implementing the search engine using a Binary Search Tree (BST). Each node of the BST stores a keyword along with an associated list of URLs. Implemented insert, search, and delete operations for keywords.
#Usage
1.	Run the program.
2.	Enter the filename containing data.
3.	Enter keywords to search.
4.	View the list of URLs matching the keywords.
